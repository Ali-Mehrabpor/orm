# Simple PHP ORM

A simple PHP ORM for easy database interaction.

## Introduction

This project is a lightweight and intuitive ORM in PHP designed to simplify database interaction. Currently, it uses a custom implementation for data management, but future versions will migrate to the ActiveRecord pattern to leverage its benefits, such as a simpler API and faster development. This ORM is suitable for projects that require a simple solution without unnecessary complexities.

## Features

*   Model definition
*   Relationship management between tables (one-to-one, one-to-many)
*   Performing common database queries (CRUD)
*   Simple and intuitive API

## Future Plans

*   Migration to the ActiveRecord pattern for improved API and faster development.
*   Adding support for more complex relationships between tables.
*   Providing more comprehensive documentation and examples.
